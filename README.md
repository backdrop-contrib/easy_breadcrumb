Easy Breadcrumb
===============

The Easy Breadcrumb module provides a block with an alternative URL-based
breadcrumb trail.

The Easy Breadcrumb block uses the current URL alias and the current page's
title to automatically extract the breadcrumbs and respective links. It also
includes the current page title as the final unlinked crumb which follows
breadcrumb best-practices. See
https://www.nngroup.com/articles/breadcrumb-navigation-useful.

Easy Breadcrumb takes advantage of the work you've already done for generating
your path aliases, and naturally encourages the creation of semantic and
consistent paths. The module is really a plug and play module because it
auto-generates the breadcrumb by using the current URL. Nothing extra is needed.

This module is currently available for Drupal 6, 7, 8, and Backdrop CMS.
